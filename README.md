Excuse my lack of documentation, It's 6 in the morning and no thank you!

progress: v.0.1.0
  - basic framing and such
  - keyboard inputs
  - drawing of the player (only a box)
  - drawing of scores and lives
  - complete removal of any documentation at all!
  
Immediate TODO:
  - Documentation, find a standard one, doxygen/javadoc like
  - Game timer
  - Get the player sprite picture set up.
  - Put score/lives in initial draw.
  - Rename EVERYTHING, it's obvious that the scope has changed.
  
Longer TODO:
  - Obviously finish the core game.
  - Title screen
  - High score screen.
  
Maybe TODO:
  - Custom pixel art, because stealing sucks.
  - Generated midi tunes, for learnin' purposes!
  - Sprite animations. (explosions, fire, etc)
  
Contributing (For good practice):
  Don't, this is for learning, pull requests denied.
